Include at least three significant scientific discoveries, advances and milestones using documented facts and figures:</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr"> In 1953, Barrett Green described the process of creation of oil-containing microcapsules. He used a method called salt-coacervation to produce these capsules. The microcapsules that he produced were several microns in diameter, and each one contained oil surrounded by a relatively thick wall of gelled colloid material. Through his observations, he found that the capsules could be dispersed in water, but they tended to agglomerate like bunches of grapes when water was removed.</p>
<p dir="ltr"> James Hayward, along with other scientists in 1986, created a new type of microcapsule that was more conducive for the delivery of drugs. He created a capsule that would encapsulate its payload with liposomes, which were encapsulated in a hydrocolloid matrix that could be composed of gelatin. This type of microcapsule could be used for drug delivery because of the structure of the liposomes. Previous microcapsule designs would only be able to carry larger components due to the relative leakiness of the design.</p>
<p dir="ltr"> Another advancement in the use of nanoparticles to deliver treatments was the creation of nanocapsules. Nanocapsules had a similar structure to microcapsules, but they were significantly smaller, on the order of nanometers instead of microns. These nanocapsules were useful because cells could take them in because of their relatively small size. Because of the similarities between microcapsules and nanocapsules, advancement in nanocapsules can also apply to microcapsules.</p>

<p dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-6b07b4cf-3779-a445-b656-5b79f947c370">Task 2 - Identify two scientists or engineers who have made major contributions to the development of the technical application your team selected and explain how their work is related:</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">One scientist who made great strides in the field of nanocapsule delivery of targeted medicines is Peter Burkhard from UConn. Dr. Burkhard had managed to make a treatment using nanocapsules for the deadliest form of malaria parasite known as Plasmodium falciparum. The standard problem with making treatments for malaria lies in the ability of the malaria parasite to hide and avoid detection from the immune system. The treatment that Dr. Burkhard made, though, is able to find the parasite utilizing the perfect symmetry and 60 faces of nanoparticles that can seek the parasite out. The particle then induces the immune system to attack the parasite leading to the death of the parasite. This method has been shown to be very effective in mice with a 90-100 percent success rate of eradicating the parasite. Another researcher who made great strides in the study of nanocapsules in medicine is Yuan Ping from Nanyang Technological University in Singapore who has created an oral treatment that has bacteria coated with nanoparticles that serve as a nanocapsule delivering the treatment. This is done in order to make sure that the bacteria can make it through the digestive tract and into the area of the tumor. Then the bacteria induces a surge in the immune system in order to block off the blood vessels and inhibit tumor angiogenesis (<a href="http://medicalxpress.com/tags/blood+vessel+formation/" target="_blank">blood vessel formation</a>). This will starve the tumor of the resources it needs and prevent it from metastasizing. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-6b07b4cf-3779-a445-b656-5b79f947c370">Task 3 - Explain how the technical application your team is researching is currently being used to solve the problem in Component One. Include documentation regarding at least two benefits and two limitations:</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">Nanocapsules are currently being used to solve the issue by being marked with surface properties of specific cells, using nanoconstructs that are targeted to specific cellular receptors. These nanocapsules can carry drugs to be delivered to the cancerous cell in order to kill it. There are certainly many advantages to this method of attacking pancreatic cancer such as increasing the accuracy of intracellular drug delivery, helping to destroy tumor stromal fibroblasts, and facilitating the penetration of the tumor endothelial cell layer. Additionally, nanocapsules are superior to other vectors such as viral vectors because they have greater potential when carrying treatments other than genetic treatments and also do not stimulate an immune response. Another method of treating pancreatic cancer involves a drug housed by a biodegradable nanoparticle. This method though is disadvantageous though, because these nanoparticles are hard to produce, and when used, are somewhat ineffective at raising the concentration of drugs.</p>

<p dir="ltr">
  Science has made many advancements in nanocapsule and microcapsule technology. Scientists began by creating basic microcapsules that could contain a specific item inside. As time progressed, microcapsule use began to become more feasible and stable, and drugs with even smaller components were able to be carried by them. Eventually, changes in capsule production allowed scientists to create nanocapsules, an even smaller version of a microcapsule. By adding surface markers and attaching antibodies to these nanocapsules, scientists were able to create targeted treatments that would attach to a specific type of cell, such as Dr. Burkhard&rsquo;s approach to seeking parasites out, which had higher efficiencies and different approaches than other, more conventional treatments. The field of nano and micro encapsulation enables unique and effective approaches to the most pressing problems of today.</p>
