</p>
<p dir="ltr">Our team first assigned each group member to research one task in each component. Once finished, our team members worked together to review the research and then write initial drafts of the Components. After sending the components to our technical advisor, Dr. Kim, we took his feedback on our research and ideas and we revised it accordingly. Once revised, we reported back to our teacher notifying her of our progress so that she knew that we could move forward with all of our components and the fair as as whole.<br />

<p dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-6b07b4cf-3336-8da6-a0a3-f3dbe7c7e734">Task 2 - Research and Innovation (what your team learned about researching and innovating a<strong>Â </strong>solution to a real world problem):</strong><br />
</p>
<p dir="ltr">One of the first things that our team learned about research and innovation is that it required deep and thorough research of a field in order to fully understand the scope what the problem is. By doing deep and intensive research it is possible to see what other scientists have done in the field of research previously and any failed attempts that have taken place to solve the issue. We discovered that knowledge of the previous attempts towards similar solutions were needed, as the best science is done when built off of the others&rsquo; shoulders.<br />

<p dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-6b07b4cf-3336-8da6-a0a3-f3dbe7c7e734">Task 3 - Three Lessons Learned During the Program:</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">The most important lesson that we learned is that constant communication was necessary between the team and advisor. We learned the value of consistent communication to make sure that our advisor and us were on the same page. Next, we learned that splitting up the work was necessary. In the beginning, each person attempted to complete large blocks of work. However, we soon found that it was advantageous to split up chunks of work. Finally, we realized that we needed to be open to suggestions, as the professional opinion of others can greatly improve our project.</p>
