<p dir="ltr">We propose the delivery of a cancer treatment through a nanocapsule. The nanocapsules will be created with Poly(amidoamine) (PAMAM) dendrimers (generation 4), which have large potential in the field of drug delivery though nanocapsules, through their biocompatible attributes and their predictable surface and container properties. The nanocapsules will specifically bind to pancreatic cells that are cancerous using antibodies specifically marked for proteins found on the surface of pancreatic cancer cells. Antibodies can be used for the identification of proteins like the 99 proteins specific to pancreatic cancer cells below. In addition, folate receptor antibodies/folic acid can be used because pancreatic cancer cells contain a larger number of these receptors. When the nanocapsules are attached to the pancreatic cancer cells, a gene inside the nanocapsules, like a functioning copy of a tumor suppressor gene such as p53 may be inserted for the promotion of apoptosis to prevent pancreatic cancer growth. Because working copies of p53 will be inserted, this treatment should have little to no side effect on other cells even if it is taken up by them, as normal cells already have working copies of p53. An approach where p53 was used has not been applied before to pancreatic cancer, and also has had extremely limited application in the field of nanoparticles. Additionally, siRNA or a CRISPR product targeting mutated copies of KRAS may be delivered instead, as the smaller size of this payload would significantly ease production of this nanocapsule. This would be effective because it silences the production of one of the first mutated genes in pancreatic cancer. Even if this were to be incorporated into a normal cell, it would be harmless as the normal copy of the KRAS gene would not be mutated, so the treatment would not identify it. Another interesting aspect of these nanocapsules are that they may be inserted before the first signs of pancreatic cancer because of their ability to only bind to proteins found on pancreas cells that are cancerous. After the treatment is immediately applied, it begins silencing KRAS or making sure that a normal copy of p53 is present, thus beginning cancer treatment immediately. Afterwards, these nanocapsules may also be able to invade cancer cells that have metastasized, if it has gotten that far.</p>

<p dir="ltr"> One of the promises that this new system of treating cancer brings about is the possibility for the cost of cancer treatment to go down considerably. This is because the treatment only has to be used a few times in order to attack the cancer effectively. One or two injections of the treatment should be extremely effective against this type of pancreatic cancer. This is a major improvement of current treatments that need to be repeated and are also very expensive. Initially buying the machinery need for radiation is expensive, as is maintaining it. This treatment will reduce the need for those machines. It will also make treating cancer more affordable for insurance companies and will reduce insurance premiums for all making it a huge positive impact on the economy.</p>

<p dir="ltr"> There are several different entities that can provide the infrastructure and resources that are necessary for the research and the clinical trials that must take place for this solution to come into play. One such institution is the National Institute of Health (NIH), specifically the Nanotechnology Characterization Lab, which has both done research in nanotechnology and cancer. In addition to the NIH, there exist many pharmaceutical companies that have the resources required to undertake such a research project, with two such examples being Pfizer and Novartis. Finally, the clinical trials that need to take place for this drug can take place at companies like PRC Clinical and Datapharm Australia, which have previously directed clinical trials.</p>

<br />
<p dir="ltr">To Whom It May Concern,</p>
<br />
<p dir="ltr">My name is Edward L. and I am a freshman at the Bergen County Academies in New Jersey. I am working with Ciro R. and Shalin P. in an online science fair called ISTF (Internet Science and Technology Fair) where students are encouraged to think about future ideas. We heard about your research in the cancer area and the work that you&rsquo;ve done in the Nanotechnology Characterization Lab, and we&rsquo;re wondering if you could provide some feedback about our idea.</p>
<br />
<p dir="ltr">In our research, we realized that correct pancreatic cancer treatments were extremely ineffective, as pancreatic cancer has almost a 100% mortality rate over a longer period of time. Our idea is a type of nanocapsule that will house certain genetic treatments for pancreatic cancer, such as a working copy of a tumor suppressor gene like p53. It will be coated with antibodies specifically for surface markers occurring mostly on pancreatic cancer cells. These capsules could be introduced before the onset of pancreatic cancer symptoms, which could allow the instant recognition of these cells after such surface markers appear.</p>
<br />
<p dir="ltr">We believe that this solution will be superior to other viral vectors as a nanocapsule is capable of carrying other treatments besides genetic treatments, and because nanocapsules do not stimulate an immune response, which will enable them to be introduced in the body before any symptoms appear.</p>
<br />
<p dir="ltr">Our team understands that you may be busy, but we would be extremely grateful if you could supply any feedback on this idea. If you need any additional information, you can find it at: <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1slASMWPOxHtd323sL0Hvh5yRKFrPW94g91JeNE8g88U/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">https://docs.google.com/document/d/1slASMWPOxHtd323sL0Hvh5yRKFrPW94g91JeNE8g88U/edit?usp=sharing</a></p>

<br />
<p dir="ltr">Hi Edward,</p>
<p dir="ltr"> </p>
<p dir="ltr">Thanks for the enquiry and presenting an idea to overcome pancreatic cancer development. There are several caveats based on limited information provided by you.</p>
<p dir="ltr"> </p>
<ol>
  <li dir="ltr">
    <p dir="ltr">As mentioned, pancreatic cancer development takes a long time. In addition, diagnosis is usually at a late-stage when the prognosis is poor. Initial mutation is in KRAS oncogene followed by p53/other cycle genes.</p>
  </li>
  <li dir="ltr">
    <p dir="ltr">Depositing a nanocapsule containing wild type p53 with a targeting ligand at the pancreatic site is an interesting thought.</p>
  </li>
  <ol>
    <li dir="ltr">
      <p dir="ltr">Stability of the nanocapsule over a several years.</p>
    </li>
    <li dir="ltr">
      <p dir="ltr">Expression of targeting ligand over different stages of tumor development.</p>
    </li>
    <li dir="ltr">
      <p dir="ltr">Biocompatibility of the nanocapsule (e.g., perturbs cellular functions at the site of implant, interaction with immune cells).</p>
    </li>
    <li dir="ltr">
      <p dir="ltr">How the introduction of nanocapsule will be determined in patient population? Initial inflammatory reaction at the pancreatic site is asymptomatic.</p>
    </li>
    <li dir="ltr">
      <p dir="ltr">How is the release and delivery of p53 controlled prior to disease development, delivery can be compromised due to predominant desmoplastic stroma. &nbsp;</p>
    </li>
  </ol>
</ol>
<p dir="ltr"> </p>
<p dir="ltr">I want to commend you for your idea, research the pancreatic cancer and understanding the complexity involved in the drug delivery. Please feel free to reach out to me, if you need further assistance.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Best wishes,</p>

<br />
<p dir="ltr">Dr. Adiseshaiah:</p>
<br />
<p dir="ltr">Thank you for taking some time to reply to our email and give us some feedback.</p>
<br />
<p dir="ltr">We had some ideas pertaining to your previous feedback that we would like to share with you. We would be extremely grateful if you could provide some feedback.</p>
<br />
<ol>
  <li dir="ltr">
    <p dir="ltr">Seeing that pancreatic cancer is usually diagnosed at a later stage, we were thinking that this treatment could be delivered before the onset of symptoms, starting from a certain age and onwards as deemed necessary. This way, the nanocapsules can begin to deliver the treatment as soon as the targeting ligand on the nanocapsule binds to a receptor on the cell. Would this approach be feasible?</p>
    </li>
  <li dir="ltr">
    <p dir="ltr">For the stability of the nanocapsule, we were thinking that trials could be conducted to identify the longevity and effectiveness of such a treatment, which could then lead to determining the frequency of re-administration</p>
    </li>
  <li dir="ltr">
    <p dir="ltr">One potential receptor that we were considering was the folate receptor (FRβ+) which seem prevalent in pancreatic cancer cells, as we found here: <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22350599" target="_blank">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22350599</a>. Would this be potentially possible to target?</p>
    </li>
  <li dir="ltr">
    <p dir="ltr">We identified Poly(amidoamine) (PAMAM) dendrimers as a potential material for these nanocapsules, which can improve biocompatibility. Do you have any feedback on this?</p>
    </li>
  <li dir="ltr">
    <p dir="ltr">Our group was thinking of beginning the administration of the drug after a certain age, where risk of pancreatic cancer is empirically shown to increase in a certain demographic group.</p>
    </li>
  <li dir="ltr">
    <p dir="ltr">Regarding predominant desmoplastic stroma, would delivery still be compromised if nanocapsules specifically targeted receptors predominantly on pancreatic cancer cells?</p>
    </li>
</ol>
<br />
<p dir="ltr">Again, we&rsquo;d like to thank you for taking your time to respond to our previous email.</p>

<p dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-6b07b4cf-377a-b840-c9c2-59e805b45f52">On February 26, we received this response:</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">Hi Edward,</p>
<p dir="ltr"> </p>
<p dir="ltr">Unfortunately, none of us knows who and when anyone will get cancer. There are risk factors such as smoking, obesity, African American community, and diabetic patients are more prone from getting the disease. Most of the cancers, if detected early can be surgically resected, which provides better option from avoiding reoccurrence and using cytotoxic drugs. Most of the pancreatic tumors at an early stage remain asymptomatic and difficult to detect. Only at a later stage, symptoms manifest.</p>
<p dir="ltr"> </p>
<p dir="ltr">Following the initiation of pancreatic disease, initially by increased inflammatory response at the pancreas, followed by mutation in KRAS, and it takes over a decade for other mutations to occur and progress the disease to metastatic stage. At this stage, the disease is difficult to resect and function is compromised.</p>
<p dir="ltr"> </p>
<p dir="ltr">My suggestion would be keeping the same concept and evaluate its efficacy in a mouse model with p53 mutation. Other factors - such as release of the plasmid, immunogenicity, expression of gene and receptor (most of it stromal cells and only &lt;20% comprises of cancer cells), and evaluating toxicity from platform (dendrimer).</p>
<p dir="ltr"> </p>
<p dir="ltr">I hope this information is helpful.</p>
